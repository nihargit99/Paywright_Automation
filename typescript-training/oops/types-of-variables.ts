Types of variables in TypeScript Classes

1. Local variable => The variable declared inside the method .
2. Instance variable => The variable is declared outside of the method but inside the class. 
3. Static variable => The variable declared outside of the method but inside the class along with the static keyword 
    when we declare static keyword, then it shouldn't store inside the class, it store alongsdie with the class.
4. Global Variable => The variable declared outside of the class

class Employee {

        console.log(`Employee Name: ${this.empName}, Employee Salary: ${empSalary}, Employee ID: ${Employee.empId}`);
    }

let obj = new Employee();
// console.log(obj.salary); // Error: Property 'salary' does not exist on type 'Employee'. for this its commented
console.log(obj.empName); // Accessing instance variable using object
console.log(companyName); //Accessing global variable without creating any object 
console.log(Employee.empId);//Accessing the static variable without creating an object instead will take a reference to the class name.
